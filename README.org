#+title: Libre TNIL documentation
* Overview
[[http://ithkuil.net/][Ithkuil]] is a constructed language created by John Quijada, and TNIL
("The Next Ithkuilic Language") is a successor language sharing many
of its design values.

This repo contains a community-driven, libre set of documentation for
TNIL family, including graphics illustrating several
morphological categories.

* Contributing to documentation
Categories shall be documented in yaml, in the folder of the same
name.

Each category requires:
 * a name,
 * an overview appropriate for a tool-tip (2 sentences max).
 * an thorough explanation of a few paragraphs,
 * a listing of category values.

Each category value shall also have:
 * a name,
 * an abbreviation
 * a brief description,
 * an in depth version with optional illustration.

** Style notes:
 * Brief descriptions should begin with a verb and omit the name of
   the category/value that is the subject of the verb. For instance,
   "refers to a single instance" instead of "Uniplex refers to a
   single instance".

* Graphics
Graphics are available for several categories.

Each category value illustration should be an SVG object less than
512Ã—512 px.

** Configuration
Configuration describes the physical similarity and spatial
connectedness of the items named by the root.

** Affiliation
Affiliation communicates similarities and dissimilarities of use and
purpose between members of the configurative set.

** Perspective
Perspective quantifies the configurative set as a single, multiple,
universal, or conceptual instance of the root.

** Extension
Extension picks out a spatiotemporal part of the set (beginning, end),
its dynamics (increasing, decreasing), and its characterization as
either circumscribed by or transcending the discursive context.
