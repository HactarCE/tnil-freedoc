#+title: Libre TNIL documentation
* Overview
[[http://ithkuil.net/][Ithkuil]] is a constructed language created by John Quijada, and TNIL
("The New Ithkuilic Language") is a successor language sharing many
of its design values.

This repo contains a community-driven, libre set of documentation for
TNIL family, including graphics illustrating several
morphological categories.

* Contributing to documentation
The formatting guidelines are laid out in the file [[file:yaml/morphology/_template.yaml::---][yaml/morphology/_template.yaml]].
* Graphics
Graphics are available for several categories.

Each category value illustration should be an SVG object less than
512Ã—512 px.

** Configuration
Configuration describes the physical similarity and spatial
connectedness of the items named by the root.

** Affiliation
Affiliation communicates similarities and dissimilarities of use and
purpose between members of the configurative set.

** Perspective
Perspective quantifies the configurative set as a single, multiple,
universal, or conceptual instance of the root.

** Extension
Extension picks out a spatiotemporal part of the set (beginning, end),
its dynamics (increasing, decreasing), and its characterization as
either circumscribed by or transcending the discursive context.
