#+title: Libre Ithkuil & TNIL documentation  
* Overview
[[http://ithkuil.net/][Ithkuil]] is a constructed language created by John Quijada, and TNIL is a successor language sharing many of its design values.

This repo contains a community-driven, libre set of documentation for the language family, including graphics illustrating several morphological categories.

* Documentation
Categories shall be documented in markdown. Each category requires:
 * a name,
 * an overview appropriate for a tool-tip (2 sentences max),
 * an thorough explanation of a few paragraphs,
 * a listing of category values.

Each category value will also have:
 * a name,
 * a brief description,
 * an in depth version with optional illustration.

* Graphics
Graphics are available for several categories.
Each category value illustration should be an SVG object less than 512Ã—512 px.
