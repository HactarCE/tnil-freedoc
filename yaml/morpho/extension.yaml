name: extension
brief: spatiotemporal limits relative to current context
full: |
  Extension describes a spatiotemporal part of the set (beginning vs. end) and
  its dynamics (gradual vs. immediate beginning/end), and its characterization
  as either circumscribed by or transcending the discursive context (i.e., is
  the whole object being discussed, or only part of it?).

  There are six Extensions:
